If you are a flight simulator enthusiast, you probably know how important it is to keep your navigation data up to date. Navigation data, or AIRAC cycles, are released every 28 days by the Aeronautical Information Service (AIS) and contain information such as waypoints, airways, navaids, procedures, and more.

## Step 1: Download and Install FMS Data Manager
 
The first step is to download and install the FMS Data Manager from the Navigraph website. The FMS Data Manager is a tool that allows you to easily update your flight simulator with the latest AIRAC cycles. You can also use it to manage your addons and backup your data.

## Step 2: Scan Your Addons and Select Your Flight Simulator
 
The next step is to scan your addons and select your flight simulator. The FMS Data Manager will automatically detect your installed addons and flight simulators. You can also add them manually if they are not detected.
 
To scan your addons and select your flight simulator, open the FMS Data Manager and go to the Addon Mappings tab. Here you will see a list of addons that are compatible with Navigraph data. You can check or uncheck the ones you want to update.
 
Then go to the Addon List tab and select your flight simulator from the drop-down menu. In this case, we will choose [FS9 FSX P3D] as our flight simulator. You can also select multiple simulators if you have more than one installed.
 
## Step 3: Download and Install AIRAC Cycle 1501
 
The final step is to download and install AIRAC cycle 1501 for your flight simulator and addons. The FMS Data Manager will automatically download the latest cycle available for your subscription.

Once the update is complete, you can close the FMS Data Manager and launch your flight simulator. You should see a message confirming that your navigation data has been updated to AIRAC cycle 1501. You can also check the cycle number in your FMC or GPS.
