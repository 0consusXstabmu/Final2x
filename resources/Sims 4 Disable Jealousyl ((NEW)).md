## What Causes Jealousy in Sims 4?
 
Jealousy in Sims 4 occurs when a Sim thinks that their partner or love interest is unfaithful or flirting with another Sim. This can trigger an angry moodlet and make the Sim act aggressively or rudely towards other Sims. Jealousy can also affect Sims who are not in a relationship but have romantic feelings for someone else.
 
Some factors that can increase the chances of jealousy are:
 
- The jealous trait: This trait makes Sims more prone to jealousy and gives them more scenarios to get jealous in, such as not seeing their partner for a while.
- The romantic reputation: This is a hidden stat that tracks how many romantic interactions a Sim has had with different Sims. The higher the reputation, the more likely other Sims will flirt with them or get jealous of them.
- The relationship status: Sims who are married or in a committed relationship are more likely to get jealous than Sims who are single or noncommittal.
