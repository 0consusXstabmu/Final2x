- Complete the tutorial and training mode. These modes will teach you the basics of movement, combat, and character skills. You can also practice your combos, parries, counters, and grapples against bots or dummies. Don't skip these modes if you want to have a chance against real players.
- Use the grappling hook often. The grappling hook is one of the most versatile tools in Naraka Bladepoint. You can use it to traverse the map quickly, reach high places, escape from danger, or surprise your enemies from above. You can also use it to pull yourself towards an enemy or pull them towards you for a close-range attack.
- Learn the attack hierarchy. Naraka Bladepoint has three types of attacks: normal attacks, focus attacks (blue), and parries. Normal attacks can be interrupted by focus attacks, focus attacks can be blocked by parries, and parries can be bypassed by normal attacks. You need to learn when to use each type of attack and how to predict your enemy's moves.
- Vary your combos. Don't rely on the same combo pattern over and over again. Your enemies will learn to anticipate and counter your attacks if you are too predictable. Try to mix up your attacks with aerial moves, uppercuts, scale attacks (wall or tree attacks), or character skills. You can also cancel your attacks by dashing or crouching and then use a normal attack to catch your enemy off guard.

These are just some of the basic tips and tricks for Naraka Bladepoint. There are many more advanced techniques and strategies that you can learn as you play more matches and experiment with different weapons and characters. The best way to improve is to practice, learn from your mistakes, and have fun!
