Tony Jaa took over the directorial duties from Prachya Pinkaew, but he also faced personal and professional challenges that affected his performance and mental health.

They are part of a trilogy that celebrates the spirit and legacy of Thai martial arts and cinema. They are films that demonstrate the dedication and skill of Tony Jaa and his team, as well as the richness and diversity of Thailand.
