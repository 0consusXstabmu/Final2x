## How to Play Sims Makin Magic Full Version for Free
 
Once you have downloaded and installed Sims Makin Magic full version for free, you can start playing it right away. However, there are some things that you need to know before you dive into the magical world of Sims.
 
First of all, you need to have the original Sims game installed on your computer. Sims Makin Magic is an expansion pack that requires the base game to run. If you don't have it, you can also download it from Old-Games.com for free.
 
Secondly, you need to create a new neighborhood or use an existing one that has not been played with any other expansion pack. This is because Sims Makin Magic adds new features and content that are incompatible with other expansions. If you try to play with an old neighborhood that has been modified by another expansion pack, you may encounter errors or glitches.
 
Thirdly, you need to get familiar with the new gameplay elements that Sims Makin Magic introduces. These include:

- Magic Town: A new area where your Sims can learn and practice magic, meet other magical beings, and participate in duels and quests.
- Magic Coins: A new currency that your Sims can earn by performing magic or completing tasks in Magic Town. You can use magic coins to buy spells, ingredients, charms, and other magical items.
- Magic Meter: A new indicator that shows how much magic your Sim has left. You need to replenish your magic meter by resting or using potions. If your magic meter runs out, your Sim will suffer negative consequences such as losing skills or turning into a frog.
- Magic Skills: A new set of skills that your Sim can learn and improve by casting spells or using magical objects. There are four magic skills: creativity, logic, mechanical, and charisma. 8cf37b1e13
