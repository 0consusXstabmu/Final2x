QMAT (QC Mobile Analysis Tool) is a software application that allows users to perform various tasks on mobile devices based on Qualcomm microprocessors. QMAT can be used for debugging, testing, extracting, flashing and modifying firmware, NV items, EFS and partitions of QC mobiles. QMAT supports a wide range of QC mobile models, including HTC, BQS, Huawei and others.
 
Some of the main features of QMAT are:

- Send standard diag commands or any hexadecimal command to the mobile device via USB or COM port.
- Read out and backup all NV items, EFS and firmware in memory (SRAM).
- Flash any QC mobile (OBL Multiboot) with given bootloader and files.
- Load any file to the mobile device at any address and execute it (bootloader, AMSS, etc.).
- Read out complete NAND or NOR memory using bootloader or download mode.
- Extract information from AMSS, such as USB ID, product number, SVN, SW build and mobile type.
- Extract internal filesystem (mif, bar, sig etc. files) from AMSS.
- Crypto functions: calculate CRC-30, CRC-32, SHA1, SHA2, MD4 and MD5 of any file; decrypt and encrypt any RSA message; generate RSA private key and .pvk files; check firmware signature; search for algorithms in binary files.

QMAT is part of the QMAT Components package, which also has an API that allows users to develop software for QC mobile devices. QMAT can be downloaded for free from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], but it requires a license key to activate some features. Users can purchase a license key from the official website of QMAT or from authorized resellers.

To use QMAT, users need to have a compatible QC mobile device and a computer with a USB or COM port. Users also need to install the QMAT software and drivers on their computer and obtain a license key to activate the QMAT features. Users can follow these steps to use QMAT:

1. Connect the QC mobile device to the computer using a USB or COM cable.
2. Launch the QMAT software and enter the license key when prompted.
3. Select the device model and the port number from the drop-down menus.
4. Choose the task or command that you want to perform from the menu bar or the toolbar.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to execute the task or command.
6. View the results or logs on the QMAT interface or save them to a file.

QMAT can be used for different purposes, such as:

- Diagnosing and troubleshooting QC mobile devices by sending diag commands and reading NV items, EFS and firmware.
- Flashing and modifying QC mobile devices by loading and executing bootloaders, AMSS and other files.
- Extracting and analyzing information from QC mobile devices by reading NAND or NOR memory, AMSS and internal filesystem.
- Crypto functions by calculating CRC, SHA, MD5 and other hashes, decrypting and encrypting RSA messages, generating RSA keys and checking firmware signatures.

QMAT is a powerful tool for QC mobile analysis and flashing, but it also involves some risks. Users should be careful when using QMAT, as it may damage or brick their QC mobile devices if used incorrectly or without proper knowledge. Users should also backup their data before using QMAT, as it may erase or overwrite their data. Users should also respect the intellectual property rights of QC mobile manufacturers and developers when using QMAT.
