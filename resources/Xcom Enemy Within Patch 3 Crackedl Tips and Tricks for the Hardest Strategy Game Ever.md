XCOM: Enemy Within adds new features and content to the base game, such as new enemies, weapons, technologies, missions, and maps.

You will also face a new threat from EXALT, a rogue human organization that is trying to sabotage your efforts and use alien technology for their own gain.
 
XCOM: Enemy Within is not a standalone game, so you will need to have XCOM: Enemy Unknown installed to play it.

You will have to manage your resources, research new technologies, build your base, train your soldiers, and fight against the aliens in turn-based combat.

XCOM: Enemy Within is a game that will keep you hooked for hours with its engaging gameplay and story.

## How to Master XCOM: Enemy Within - Tips and Tricks for Beginners and Veterans
 
XCOM: Enemy Within is a game that will test your skills as a commander of a secret organization that fights against an alien invasion. You will have to balance your resources, research, base management, and combat tactics to succeed in this challenging and rewarding game. Whether you are new to the XCOM series or a veteran of the previous games, you might find some of these tips and tricks useful for your campaign.
 
- **Use Overwatch wisely.** The simplest and most effective tip for battles is to use the "Overwatch" ability. Every. Single. Turn. Unless it's a timed mission (of which there are a few), you can afford to move at a snail's pace and set up ambushes for the aliens. Overwatch allows your soldiers to fire at any enemy that moves within their line of sight, giving you an advantage over the enemy's turn. However, be careful not to trigger too many enemies at once, or you might get overwhelmed.
- **Upgrade your armor before your weapons.** Survivability is more important than firepower in XCOM: Enemy Within. You don't want to lose your experienced soldiers to a lucky shot from the aliens. That's why you should prioritize researching and building Carapace Armor, which will give your soldiers a significant boost to their health. Laser and plasma weapons are nice, but they won't do much good if your soldiers are dead.
- **Experiment with gene mods and MECs.** One of the new features of XCOM: Enemy Within is the ability to modify your soldiers with genetic enhancements or cybernetic augmentations. These can give your soldiers new abilities and advantages in combat, such as increased mobility, cloaking, mind control resistance, or flamethrowers. However, they also come with a cost: gene mods require meld, a rare resource that you have to collect from missions, and MECs require you to sacrifice a soldier's class abilities and limbs. You should experiment with different combinations of gene mods and MECs to find out what works best for your playstyle.
- **Watch out for EXALT.** Another new feature of XCOM: Enemy Within is the presence of EXALT, a rogue human faction that is working with the aliens and trying to undermine your efforts. EXALT will periodically launch covert operations against you, such as hacking your satellites, stealing your money, or spreading panic among the council countries. You will have to send one of your soldiers on a covert mission to infiltrate their cells and expose their location. Then you will have to launch an assault on their base and eliminate them. EXALT missions are tricky and dangerous, as you will have to protect your covert operative while fighting against well-equipped human enemies. You should bring your best soldiers and equipment for these missions.
- **Have fun!** XCOM: Enemy Within is a game that will challenge you, but also reward you with memorable moments and stories. You will feel attached to your soldiers as they grow from rookies to veterans, as they develop personalities and nicknames, as they pull off amazing feats or die heroic deaths. You will feel the thrill of victory when you complete a difficult mission or research a new technology. You will feel the pressure of saving humanity from extinction when you face the final showdown with the alien menace. XCOM: Enemy Within is a game that will make you feel like a true commander.
