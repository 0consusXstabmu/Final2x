The book is divided into 19 chapters, each covering a specific topic related to heat treatment. The first chapter introduces the nature of metals and alloys, their structure, defects, and properties. The second chapter explains the principles of heat treatment of steels, such as phase transformations, iron-carbon equilibrium diagram, time-temperature-transformation diagrams, and continuous cooling transformation diagrams. The third chapter describes the various heat treatment processes, such as annealing, normalizing, hardening, tempering, surface hardening, and thermochemical treatments. The fourth chapter deals with the heat treatment of commercial steels, such as plain carbon steels, alloy steels, tool steels, stainless steels, and high speed steels. The fifth chapter covers the heat treatment of cast irons, such as grey cast iron, white cast iron, malleable cast iron, nodular cast iron, and alloy cast iron. The sixth chapter discusses the heat treatment of non-ferrous metals and alloys, such as aluminium, copper, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and zinc.
 
The seventh chapter focuses on the possible defects that can occur during heat treatment, such as distortion, cracking, decarburization, oxidation, scaling, hydrogen embrittlement, temper brittleness, and residual stresses. The eighth chapter explains the causes and remedies of these defects and suggests some preventive measures. The ninth chapter outlines the inspection and quality control methods used in heat treatment, such as visual inspection, dimensional measurement, hardness testing, microstructure examination, mechanical testing, non-destructive testing, and statistical quality control. The tenth chapter reviews the heat treatment equipment and furnaces used for different processes and materials. The eleventh chapter describes the various heating media and quenching media used in heat treatment. The twelfth chapter discusses the role of protective atmospheres and vacuum in heat treatment.
 
The thirteenth chapter introduces the concept of thermomechanical treatment (TMT), which combines mechanical deformation and thermal cycles to improve the properties of metals and alloys. The fourteenth chapter explains the principles and applications of TMT processes such as hot working, cold working, warm working, hot extrusion, cold extrusion, forging, rolling, drawing, spinning, deep drawing, bending, forming etc. The fifteenth chapter covers the special TMT processes such as cryogenic treatment (CT), ausforming (AF), marforming (MF), martempering (MT), austempering (AT), patenting (PT), isothermal transformation (IT), controlled rolling (CR), controlled cooling (CC), thermomechanical controlled process (TMCP), etc. The sixteenth chapter deals with the heat treatment of powder metallurgy products such as sintering (S), hot pressing (HP), hot isostatic pressing (HIP), etc. The seventeenth chapter discusses the heat treatment of welding joints such as preheating (PH), post-heating (POH), post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), etc.
 
The eighteenth chapter presents some case studies of heat treatment problems and solutions from various industries such as automotive industry (AI), aerospace industry (ASI), nuclear industry (NI), etc. The nineteenth chapter summarizes the main points of the book and provides some suggestions for further reading. The book also includes appendices that contain useful data and tables related to heat treatment such as conversion factors (CF), physical constants (PC), material properties (MP), phase diagrams (PD), time-temperature-transformation diagrams (TTT), continuous cooling transformation diagrams (CCT), hardness conversion tables (HCT), etc.
