- Plan your tower placement carefully. You can see the enemy path by hovering over the start point. Try to cover as much area as possible with your towers and use the landmarks to your advantage. You can also sell or move your towers during the game if you need to adjust your strategy.
- Upgrade your towers wisely. You can upgrade your towers up to three times, but each upgrade costs more gold. You can also unlock new abilities for your towers by spending skill points in the skill tree. Some abilities are more useful than others depending on the situation, so experiment and see what works best for you.
- Use your spells effectively. You have four spells at your disposal: Fireball, Freeze, Meteor and Lightning. Each spell has a cooldown and a mana cost, so use them sparingly and strategically. You can also upgrade your spells with skill points to make them more powerful or reduce their cooldown.
- Watch out for different enemy types. Each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses, such as speed, health, armor, resistance and special abilities. Some enemies can fly over your towers, some can heal themselves or others, some can disable your towers or spells, and some can even summon more enemies. Learn their behaviors and counter them accordingly.
- Earn more gold and mana by killing enemies faster. The faster you kill an enemy, the more gold and mana you get. You can also get bonus gold and mana by completing achievements or using landmarks that boost your income. Gold and mana are carried over between levels, so try to save as much as you can.

Evil Defenders PC Full is a game that will challenge your strategic thinking and reflexes. It is also a game that will make you laugh with its witty dialogues and funny animations. If you are looking for a tower defense game that is fun, frenetic and evil, you should definitely try Evil Defenders PC Full.
