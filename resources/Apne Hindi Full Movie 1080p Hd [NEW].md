Apne is a 2007 Hindi film starring Dharmendra, Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Shilpa Shetty and Katrina Kaif. The film is directed by Anil Sharma and produced by Sangeeta Ahir.

The film begins with Baldev Singh Chaudhary (Dharmendra), a former boxing champion who was accused of doping and banned from the sport. He lives with his wife Raavi (Kirron Kher) and younger son Karan (Bobby Deol) in Punjab. His elder son Angad (Sunny Deol) is a successful boxer in London, but has a strained relationship with his father. Baldev gets an offer from a British boxing promoter to train an Indian boxer for the World Heavyweight title. He sees this as an opportunity to clear his name and reunite with his son Angad.

However, Angad refuses to join his father's camp and instead signs a deal with another promoter. Baldev is heartbroken and decides to train Karan instead. Karan is reluctant at first, but agrees to fulfill his father's dream. He moves to London with his father and meets Simran (Katrina Kaif), a journalist who becomes his love interest. Karan trains hard under his father's guidance and wins several matches. He also reconciles with Angad, who supports him in his career.
 
Meanwhile, Baldev suffers from a brain hemorrhage and is hospitalized. He reveals that he has been suffering from this condition for a long time and that he may not survive. He requests Angad to take over Karan's training and make him the world champion. Angad agrees and takes charge of Karan's camp. He also faces his own demons and confronts the promoter who framed his father for doping.
 
The film culminates in a thrilling climax where Karan faces the reigning champion Luke Bradley (Brandon Routh) in the final match. With Angad and Simran cheering him on, Karan fights valiantly and manages to knock out Bradley in the last round. He dedicates his victory to his father, who watches the match on TV from his hospital bed. The film ends with Baldev recovering from his surgery and reuniting with his family.
