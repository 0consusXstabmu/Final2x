Some people have claimed that the novel is based on real events and characters, and that Stankovic has revealed the secrets and scandals of some of the most influential and famous people in Serbia. Others have dismissed the novel as a fiction and a fabrication, and have accused Stankovic of lying and slandering.

Grabljivica 2 has also inspired some adaptations and imitations. In 2010, a theater group from Belgrade staged a play based on the novel, which was directed by Gorcin Stojanovic. The play was a success and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. In 2011, a film adaptation of the novel was announced, with Stankovic as the co-producer and co-writer. However, the film project was never completed due to financial and legal issues. In 2012, another Serbian writer, Jelena Bacic Alimpic, published a novel called Zauvek u srcu (Forever in My Heart), which was widely seen as a plagiarism of Grabljivica 2. Bacic Alimpic denied the allegations and said that her novel was original and different from Stankovic's.
