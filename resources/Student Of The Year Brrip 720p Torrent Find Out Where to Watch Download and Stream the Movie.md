## Student of the Year Movie Review
 
Student of the Year is not a movie that aims to be realistic or profound. It is a glossy, glamorous and glitzy spectacle that showcases the lives of rich and privileged students who compete for fame and love. The movie is full of clichÃ©s, stereotypes and melodrama, but it also has some moments of humor, romance and entertainment.
 
The movie is directed by Karan Johar, who is known for his lavish and extravagant style of filmmaking. He has created a visually stunning world of opulence and luxury, where everything is perfect and beautiful. The costumes, sets, locations and songs are all designed to dazzle the audience and create a fantasy. The movie also features some cameo appearances by popular Bollywood stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Farah Khan.
 
The movie is also a launchpad for three newcomers: Siddharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. They play the roles of Abhimanyu, Rohan and Shanaya, who are the main protagonists of the story. Abhimanyu is a poor but ambitious student who wants to make it big in life. Rohan is a rich but rebellious student who wants to prove himself to his father. Shanaya is a spoiled but insecure student who wants to win the attention of her boyfriend. The three of them get involved in a love triangle that leads to rivalry, betrayal and friendship.
 
The movie has its flaws and shortcomings. The plot is predictable and formulaic, the characters are one-dimensional and shallow, the dialogues are cheesy and corny, the emotions are artificial and exaggerated, the logic is flawed and absurd, the message is superficial and clichÃ©d. The movie also has some problematic aspects such as nepotism, sexism, homophobia and elitism.
 
However, the movie also has its merits and strengths. The performances of the three newcomers are decent and promising. They have good screen presence and chemistry with each other. They also show their skills in dancing and action sequences. The movie also has some catchy and upbeat songs that add to the fun factor. The movie also has some comic relief provided by Rishi Kapoor, who plays the role of a gay dean who has a crush on Ronit Roy, who plays the role of a strict coach.
 
Student of the Year is a movie that does not take itself seriously or expect you to do so. It is a movie that appeals to your senses rather than your intellect or emotions. It is a movie that you can watch if you want to enjoy some mindless entertainment and escapism.
