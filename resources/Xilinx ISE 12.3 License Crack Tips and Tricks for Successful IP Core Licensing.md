Xilinx ISE 12.3 Design Suite is a comprehensive and integrated design environment that supports the entire design flow from specification to implementation and verification. It includes various tools and features that enable you to create high-quality and optimized designs for Xilinx programmable devices. Some of the main tools and features of Xilinx ISE 12.3 Design Suite are:

- XST Synthesis: This is a logic synthesis tool that transforms your HDL code into a netlist that can be mapped to Xilinx programmable devices. It supports various languages, such as VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog, and offers various options and strategies for synthesis optimization.
- PlanAhead: This is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that helps you analyze, floorplan, and implement your design. It allows you to explore different design scenarios, perform what-if analysis, and optimize your design for performance, power, and area.
- ISE Simulator (ISim): This is a functional and timing simulation tool that allows you to verify the functionality and timing of your design. It supports mixed-language simulation, waveform viewing and editing, assertion-based verification, and debugging features.
- Project Navigator: This is a project management tool that helps you organize and manage your design files and processes. It allows you to create and edit projects, run design tools, view reports and results, and launch other tools from within a single interface.
- Software Development Kit (SDK): This is an integrated development environment (IDE) for creating embedded software applications for Xilinx programmable devices. It supports various processors, such as MicroBlaze and PowerPC, and offers various features, such as code editing, compiling, debugging, and profiling.
- System Generator for DSP: This is a high-level tool for designing high-performance DSP systems using Xilinx programmable devices. It allows you to use MATLAB and Simulink to model, simulate, and generate HDL code for your DSP system.

Xilinx ISE 12.3 Design Suite also supports various IP cores that can help you accelerate your design process and enhance your system functionality. IP cores are pre-designed and verified blocks of logic that can be easily integrated into your design. Xilinx offers a large repository of IP cores for various applications, such as memory interfaces, communication protocols, signal processing, encryption, video processing, and more. You can also create your own custom IP cores using Xilinx tools or third-party tools.
 
To use Xilinx IP cores in your design, you need to use the CORE Generator tool that is part of Xilinx ISE 12.3 Design Suite. The CORE Generator tool allows you to browse, configure, generate, and instantiate IP cores in your design. It also provides documentation and simulation models for each IP core. Some of the IP cores in Xilinx ISE 12.3 Design Suite require additional licenses to use them in your design. You can obtain these licenses from the Xilinx Product Licensing Site or from the IP core vendor .
